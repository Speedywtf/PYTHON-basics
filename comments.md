in basic language, a comment is anything that the system or software will not run.```

#Single Line Comments

```If you want to write a comment for only one line, you can use a # in the start of the line to specify that it is a comment

EXAMPLE: #This is a single line comment

You can also have this at the end of a line

EXAMPLE: print('Hi') #This is a comment```

#Multi Line Comments

```IF you want to have a comment that takes up multiple lines, you can either just use a # every line, although this gets tiring and too repetitive, a better alertnative is to use 
a multiline string (""")

EXAMPLE: 

"""

THIS IS A COMMENT 
WHICH TAKES UP
MULTIPLE LINES 
"""```
